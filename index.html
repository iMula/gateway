            <h1>Why Toronto?</h1>
          </article>
            <p>
            Toronto, capital of Ontario, is the largest city in Canada and also one of the most diverse. It's home to a dynamic mix of tourist attractions, from museums and galleries to the world-famous CN Tower. And just a short drive away is Niagara Falls. Moreover, the city is positioned on the edge of some of the best farmland in Canada, with a climate favourable to growing a wide range of crops, thereby making Toronto a transportation, distribution, and manufacturing center.

          <h1>The Most Multicultural City In The World</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are over 250 ethnicities present in the Toronto region, with 180 different dialects spoken. Just about every corner of the world is represented, from Portugal to Pakistan. Chinese are one of the largest populations in the city, with upwards of 300,000 residents, which represents a whopping 10% of Toronto’s immigrant population.
            There’s nothing Torontonians love more than a street festival, and with so many different cultures around it seems like there’s always an excuse to get together and celebrate. Some of the city’s most popular festivals include the Roncesvalles Polish Festival, which serves up Polish culture with Polka music and pierogi dumplings, and the Toronto Chinatown Festival, where you’ll find martial arts performances, authentic Asian street foods, and the lion and dragon dancing.
